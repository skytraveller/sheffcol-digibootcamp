1.1 Explain the key features of object oriented programming.
1.2 Explain the importance of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in object  oriented
programming.

Object orientated programming, also known as OOP, is a method, or paradigm, of
coding applications,  complex or simple, in a much easier and smarter way by
breaking down a problem in smaller  bits and building a solution from them. The
basis of this is to create a template by  defining a class (a collection of
properties and methods) and creating objects  (or instances) from that class.
How this is used varies on the language, for example;


// C++
class Student
{
    public:
        int age = 0;
        string name = "";
};

class ArtStudent: public Student { };

class TechStudent: public Student { };


# Python
class Student:
    age = 0
    name = ""

class ArtStudent(Student):
    pass

class TechStudent(Student):
    pass


Some of OOP's most important features include;

Abstraction - Creating a high-level and simpler set of methods to use low level
and more complicated code. An example is a keyboard or mouse. Catching each
keydown and keyup event would require work to track it's state. In this
instance, the on keypress event will catch both keyup and keydown and
simplifies the low-lever code for us. This can be as simple as keeping a
property in a class discrete and private to communicating with underlying
hardware drivers behind the scenes.

Encapsulation - Grouping variables and
methods to create objects from class definitions. This allows us to group
together common used methods and attributes or properties to create a class
definition. This immensely helps keep code clean and modular and allows us to
create objects from them.

Inheritance - Creating a base class or template that
can then be used or even extended as if it is the parent or base class.
Multiple inheritance is possible with python. For instance, you could start by
defining a base class called Transports with only a variable named
numberofwheels and a default value of 0. From that, we could create Bikes and
Cars with the default numberofwheels of 2 and 4, respectively. We could even go
on to create Tricycles, inheriting from Bikes and make its default
numberofwheels 3 and so on.

Polymorphism - A way of completing a task using a
previously defined methods but not knowing witch one will be executed at
run-time. We create functions that complete a task in multiple ways but when
executed, the function may complete the task differently depending on the data
passed to it or even at random if that is the desired outcome. This is an
incredibly powerful way in python to create a single function that handles 
multiple needed operations whereas in other languages, you may have to define a
different function for each data type.

More features include things such as being able to keep code private and
discrete with in classes, creating modular code that can be re-used and updated
much easier and selectively, letting the developer only focus on the needed
parts and separating a big problem into smaller, easier, byte-size problems. 


2.1 Demonstrate use of object oriented tools and techniques.

Templating and using inheritence is my favorite tool of OOP. I use these tools
in nearly every project I create. One of the very first things I commonly do is
to create base classes for objects with default properties and functions they
need and extend them as needed. This speeds up development by an unimaginable
amount of time. Another common practice for me is to create or use frameworks
with even more standard defined classes and functions. Another core concept is
abstraction is grouping variables and/or properties

See 1.2 for an example of inheritance.

An example of encapsulation is as follows;

// C++
int studentlukeage = 0;
string studentlukename = "";
int studentbobage = 0;
string studentbobname = "";

class Student
{
    public:
        int age = 0;
        string name = "";
};

Student luke = Student();
luke.name = "luke";
Student bob = Student();
bob.name = "bob";

# Python
class vehicle:
    numberOfWheels = 0
    def move(self, distance):
        pass

class boat(vehicle):
    pass

class car(vehicle):
    numberOfWheels = 4
    def honkhorn(self, distance):
        pass


3.1 Design an object oriented program.

I am going to create a simple program to create a record of a student that shows
how old they are and how many courses they are enrolled in. I will do this by
creating a class with the mentioned properties and common methods to used by
different types of students. Different types of students with be created by
inheriting a base class. Later updates will add user input to dynamically create
students and add them to a database.

 
3.2 Develop an object oriented program.

/*

This program is a very simple example of OOP programming to create and print simple student records.

gcc 3.X.cpp -lstdc++

*/

#include <iostream> 

using namespace std;

class Student
{
    /*
        Student - The base class used in this program.

        This class uses the private variables: name, type, age and numberofcourses with getters and setters.
        This class can be printed using the 'print' function.
    */

    public:

        Student()
        {
            // This blank method is needed so this class and derived classes can handle being initiated without an argument.
            // cout <<  "Student created!\n";
        }
        Student(string namevar)
        {
            setName(namevar);
        }

        // ~Student()
        // {
            // This method has been commented out due to not being needed, yet.
            // cout <<  "Student destroyed!\n";
        // }

        int getAge(void)
        {
            return age;
        }
        void setAge(int v)
        {
            age = v;
        }

        string getName(void)
        {
            return name;
        }
        void setName(string v)
        {
            name = v;
        }

        int getNumberOfCourses(void)
        {
            return numberofcourses;
        }
        void setNumberOfCourses(int v)
        {
            numberofcourses = v;
        }

        void print()
        {
            cout << "Student: " << getName() << endl;
            cout << getAge() << " years old, currently taking " << getNumberOfCourses() << " course(s)." << endl;
        }

        void set(string nme, int age, int noc)
        {
            if (nme != "")
            {
                setName(nme);
            }
            setAge(age);
            setNumberOfCourses(noc);
        }

    private:
        int age = 0;
        int numberofcourses = 0;
        string name = "";
        string type = "";
};

class ArtStudent: public Student
{
    private:
        string type = "art";
};

class TechStudent: public Student
{
    private:
        string type = "tech";
};

int main()
{
    // Create a student, set it's properties, print to screen, repeat.

    Student luke("Luke");
    luke.setAge(21);
    luke.setNumberOfCourses(1);
    luke.print();

    ArtStudent bob;
    bob.set("bob", 29, 2);
    bob.print();

    TechStudent john;
    john.set("john", 28, 4);
    john.print();

    return 0;
    
}


4.1 Test an object oriented program.
Using the program created in 3.X, I have compiled it on both windows and lixux
and confirmed it compiles without error. I have also tested compiling it into a
32 and 64 bit executable. Compilining, executining and watching for the results
on any platform or architecture always gives the expected result.
While creating the program, I also tested it after adding new pieces of code I
had created, changing the value of variables, even to purposely invalid values
sometimes, to see if it still gives the correct result when compiled and executed.

4.2 Document appropriate action to correct errors.
Upon first compilation, I had forgotten to uncomment the TechStudent class. The
compiler gave an undefined error telling me the code it was looking for didn't exist
yet so I followed to where the error was found, using the breadcrumb navigation gcc
prints and the start of the errors and uncommented the class. After recompiling,
the new program, with the code I called actually being included, the program
executed without problem.
Later, I was given a syntax error. In the same fashion, I hunted down the problem
and found I had forgot a semi-colon. Adding one fixed the problem instantly and
the compiler could now again read the source code with running into something
it couldn't understand.

4.3 Create technical documentation for the support and maintenance of the program.
Please see the comments included in 3.X. I have used these comments to document
what the program actually does and how it goes about doing so. These comments also
document what objects are being created and how they are to be used. Technical
doumentation, be it in comments, a readme file or even a whole wiki helps explain
your code to other users and speeds up thier development time as they don't have
to learn the entire code base themselves. Aswel as this, it should be noted;
User input should be added in the next update to create and set dynamically
created student records. But, user data must ALWAYS be validated and never stored
in such a way that it is loaded for execution.
