3
Be able to design and develop an object oriented program to meet requirements.
 
Classes: class diagram, dependencies and inheritances, identification attributes, methods, the control of scope of attributes and methods, inheritance, aggregation, association, polymorphism, pre-defined classes e.g. class library, downloaded, imported.
 
Objects: e.g. constructors, destructors, building a program with reusable objects, defining relationships between objects, implementing message passing between objects.
 
Creation of program: use of development environment, debugging, data validation, error handling and reporting.
 
Programming language syntax: e.g. selecting, declaring and initialising variable and data structure types and sizes.
 
Constructs: selection e.g. if … then … else, CASE, iteration e.g. while … do, repeat … until.
 
Programming standards: e.g. use of comments, code layout, indentation.
