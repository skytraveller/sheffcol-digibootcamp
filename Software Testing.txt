1 Understand software testing

1.1 Explain the purpose and methods of software testing

Software testing is the process of checking that your program works 
as expected, given different situations. The purpose of this has many 
reasons behind it but probably the most important is to create software 
that is realiable and secure. Without these many different kinds of 
tests, your program may not work but also may open the end-user's computer 
to remote control or even irrecoverable damage. 

Testing can be split into two main types, automated and manual. Automated 
testing is executed by the machine. This can be when an event as happened 
like the software being compiled, a certain milestone hit or at random/set 
times. Automatic tests can be simple or very complex and the results are 
logged for review. On the other hand, manual testings is completed by a 
person, usually the develop first and later, a select group of testers. 
Manual testing requires a lot of time and effort from people to complete 
compared to automated testing and could be considered less thourough than 
automated testing. However, manual testing will often find problems that 
pre-written scripts are simply not looking for.


1.2 Describe the different stages and types of software testing

Different tests are better suited for differenct stages of a projects 
lifecycle. User tests are impossible to complete meaningfully if your 
project has implemented a method of the use communicating with your 
application yet. While in early development, unit tests are perfect for 
testing small pieces of code as you add them and if used correctly, will 
continue to test each piece of code as your project grows. 

As these smaller pieces build up and development starts create something 
tangable, intergration tests will start to become more and more useful. 
Leading the way for functional tests to further ensure the results are correct. 

At a later stage in your project, you may even have human testers trying to 
find problems with the front-end of your software. Different tests are more 
or less useful at different stsages of the development cycle.

Different types of software tests includes;

Unit - Unit tests are the smallest and used to test individual functions, 
methods and/or classes. They are incredibly easy to automate and most 
compilers, iteractive development enviroments and project management 
software can help implement these directly into your project.

Intergration - Intergration tests check that the smallest pieces of your 
code work correctly together. These tests are more complicated than unit 
tests due to them having more parts. They can also be easily automated 
and cover a larger section of your code base while still staying relatively 
simple.

Functional - Functional testing is very similiar to intergration testing 
however, functional testing focuses much more on the results from pieces of 
code that do work together. Primarially that the result is as expected even 
if given unexpected data or parameters.

Performance - Performance testing ensures the software can handle different 
amounts of work and that it is not effected over time. The most common method 
is stress-testing. Forcing the software to work under extreme loads and 
helping find bottle-necks or problems. 


1.3 Explain how automation is used in software testing

Automation is used in software testing to decrease the time needed to create 
and deploy tests of different kinds and also the time needed to find any 
common problems that may occur. It is very helpful and also used to check if 
an update or modification of your current code has had adverse effects. 
Combining tests with automation allows for the code to be tested every time 
it is compiled, released, even daily, something that would take 00's of hours 
for a person to complete and then report. 

Git, a version control system, has many ways to implement this tests. Using 
simple git hooks, it is very easy to run a unit test or script when an event 
happens. Another feature of some git services is pipelines. These can be used 
to compile, run and test your project automatically, at a certain time or when 
an update to the code base has been made. The reports given from pipeline tests 
can viewed live and even included on your projects homepage.

Python has a unit testing module as part of the standard called PyUnit. This 
incredibly easy-to-use tool can be used to create and run tests by creating a 
python script containing a python class derived from the TestCase class. 


1.4 Describe functional and structural testing

Functional - Functional testing is when we test how the software works 
given specified test data. This can be to check it gives the correct result 
or that it handles incorrect data gracefully.

Structural - Structural testing focuses on how code creates it's result. 
Instead of checking the result is correct, it looks at the flow of 
control. This is to ensure that conditional testing is correctly used and 
that the structure follows the correct path of execution. 


2 Be able to develop and implement a test plan

2.1 Design appropriate test data

When creating test data, the data must be both valid and invalid. Testing 
both, to an extreme length, is required for the test to be worth doing. The 
objective could be considered as trying to break or bore your program.
In this example, we will be testing the data given when a user is asked to 
login. We would expect a username and validate it is correct and safe to 
processed and then be stored. The username must be between 4 and 12 chars long, contain 
at least, one letter, one number and no symbols.

Username;
Data            Bad or Good         Reason
bob               Bad               Too short, no numbers
bobiscool!        Bad               Contains a symbol
b0b??             Bad               Contains 2 symbols
bobisfine1        Good              Matches all criteria
b1b1s1i1e1        Good              Matches all criteria
bobisnotfine1     Bad               Too many chars
59480758047       Bad               No letters
A9480758047       Good              Matches all criteria


2.2 Develop a test plan in line with requirements 

My test plan is very simple. 

  Objective - Ensure that my TulipCli application executes without error 
  and gives the expected results.

  Scope - The operations that need to be tested are create, read, update, 
  delete, search and find. The argument parser doesn't need testing.

  Strategy - Using python's unittests, any code added or modified will have 
  it's own unittest. If the project grows much bigger, the results will 
  be recorded in a database for review later. Due to this project being 
  command-line based, less tests are needed. Intergrational and 
  funtional tests will be the main ones used with a focus on security 
  and stress testing.

  Enviroment - The enviroment used to test this project is both a windows 
  and linux test suite and both machines can run on x86 or x64 architecture.


2.3 Implement a test plan and record results 

I have implemented this test plan with my project TulipCli. All unittests can be 
executed and give the expected results. Saving the results of these tests allowed
me to review the outcome laters and also logged and problems as they came up.


2.4 Produce a test report 

You can Produce a Detailed Test Report if you want to where you can mention 
Test case id, Test Description, Module name, Precondition(s), Post condition(s),
Test Title, Test designed by , Test Executed by , Test Priority (Low, Medium, 
High), Test Designed date, Test Steps, Test Data, 
Expected results, Actual results, Pass/Fail,  Corrective action taken
