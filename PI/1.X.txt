1.1 Explain the principles and concepts of programming languages.

Programming languages are specially defined languages used to translate human readable text into machine code that a device can read and execute. There are thousands of different languages availible today and more are being created as we speak. They range from very simple, almost 'standard' English using simple objects to incredibly complex, difficult-to-read and huge projects. Many of these languages can belong to different paradigms. In this context, a paradigm is a set of basic rules, concepts and methods for how the language is used. Imperative programming, also known as procederal, is how languages like ASM and C work. Blocks of memory are given names and these variables are used in a step-by-step fasion, writing, reading, copying, comparing and deleting this blocks of addressed memory. Another, very popular, way of coding, for it's speed and simplicity, is known as Object-orientated Programming. It is similiar to imperitive programming, however, variables and common methods are ogrinised into class objects. Defining a common class object with the commonly needed methods combined with other classes inheriting this properties allows for much faster development and a layer of access control to created objects.
